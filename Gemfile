# This really is asking for it
# It's a fairly comprehensive library with all sorts of statistical methods
# All I care about is Pearson's Something Coefficient, and statsample uses
# a bunch of methods that are all set to deprecated soon.
# TODO: Implement Pearson's, and covariance, and std deviation yourself.
# Can't be that hard.

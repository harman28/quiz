Some scripts to simulate quiz formats

---

I want to run some tests comparing different quiz formats. The long term goal is to prove that certain formats (infinite bounce/pounce) are 'more fair' than others (rolling bounce), and there exists a format that is 'most fair' (quite possibly a simple written test). 

This repo will get us nowhere close to that proof, but it will help us understand what we ought to be looking to prove, and that's a start.

There will probably be a ton of assumptions that are implicit in these simulations. I'll list them in a separate file.

* *Knowledgeable quizzers are better guessers:* Right now the probability of a team getting an answer right, assuming they've decided to pounce, is based only on their inherent 'strength', which is equivalent to their knowledge. Not sure if this should be changed.
* *Teams that are superior to a question will always know it, and always pounce:* This is obviously false, as confidence varies. Solve this by adding confidence as a fixed attribute for each team.
    * Should confidence vary during the quiz? Yes. Easy to implement too.
* *Teams inferior to a question will only attempt it if it is ~10% superior:*
This is so arbitrary as to make no sense. Should depend on confidence again.
